This is my first git repository.

Currently learning git through VS Code terminal

for cloning remote repo to our local system:
        git clone <link>
for checking status:
        git status

modified file or untracked file (new created one) 
are first to be add (staged file) 
then committed(permanently changed)
then pushed from our local repo to remote repo

for add : git add <file name>
for commit : git commit -m "message"
for adding all changes in one time use :
        git add .
for pushing : git push origin main
        her origin refers to the original repo which we cloned
        and main refers to the branch name to which we pushes our changes
